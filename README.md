# Eye-diseases-classification

This project focuses on the classification of eye diseases from retinal images using deep learning techniques.  
The aim is to automatically identify different ocular conditions from medical images to support early diagnosis and analysis.

## Objectives
- Preprocess and analyze eye image datasets
- Train deep learning models for disease classification
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## Dataset
Publicly available retinal / eye image datasets are used in this project.  
Dataset files are not included in the repository due to size and licensing restrictions.

## Methods
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required dependencies  
3. Run the Jupyter notebook
